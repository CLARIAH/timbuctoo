Some things that timbuctoo will not do, and that you can use other software for:

 - present the data in a faceted search (for this we're building a different tool that subscribes to timbuctoo's data)
 - clean up datasets (for this we point you to http://openrefine.org[openrefine] and https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/Web-Karma[karma])
 - visualize the data (for this we'll expose the data in timbuctoo in such a way that it can be picked up by tools such as http://hdlab.stanford.edu/projects/palladio/[palladio] or https://gephi.org/[gephi])

We will offer a basic editing interface but we'll also actively try to allow the data to be edited in external tools such as google spreadsheets, openrefine or excel.

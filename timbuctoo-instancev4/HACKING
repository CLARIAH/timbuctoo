# Commit messages
we try to adhere to http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

 . Separate subject from body with a blank line
 . Limit the subject line to 50 characters
 . Capitalize the subject line
 . Do not end the subject line with a period
 . Use the imperative mood in the subject line
 . Wrap the body at 72 characters
 . Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

We have added some conventions:

 . When working on a jira issue we tend to start the message with a reference e.g. `[TIM-432] Add security layer`
 . When a commit is a bugfix or refactoring we start with that. `Bugfix. Check if file exists before removing`
 . When the fix/refactoring is small you don't have to add anything other then bugfix/refactoring

# Coding guidelines

Optionals
 - Use them as the return value of a method when null is a valid value. This way the user of the API is forced to think about how to handle the null case.

Database retrieval
 - Use Gremlin as much as possible to execute database queries.

== BulkUpload Rml expression support

We have added support for more difficult rml expressions using the the Apache JEXL library.
You have one function `stringify`, to format values to a nice string.
You also have one variable `v`.
This variable is a map.
You van use it using by using like `v.name` where name is a column in the original excel file.

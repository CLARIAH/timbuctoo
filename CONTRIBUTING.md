**Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

change the docs were needed and submit a Pull request. You can do so from the github web interface if you like.

**Do you want to contribute code?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request in which you describe what you'd like to change using the provided template.
* Feel free to start coding right away, but we might respond that we won't merge this PR or that we'll only merge it if it's changed a bit.
* Please read the list of things timbuctoo does and does not do in the README to check if there's a good chance that we'll merge your code.

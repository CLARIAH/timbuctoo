## How to contribute to Timbuctoo

OMG someone wants to help! That's so awesome! Quick! give him some hoops to jump through!

Seriously though, this document is intended to let you know what you can expect from us and what we expect from you.

**Do you have questions?**

Talk to us on https://gitter.im/HuygensING/timbuctoo

**Did you find a bug?**

* Talk to us on https://gitter.im/HuygensING/timbuctoo or alternatively...
* ...report it using github [Issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues). It might seem awfully quiet there but we use a closed issue tracker ourselves because it has some features that github doesn't. We will get an e-mail about your issue though.
* When reporting an issue please describe
  1. A (preferrably short) list of steps
  2. what happens after those steps
  3. (if needed) why you did not expect that and what you did expect.

**Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

change the docs were needed and submit a Pull request. You can do so from the github web interface if you like.

**Do you want to contribute code?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request in which you describe what you'd like to change.
* Use the following template:
  ```
*Context*
<<here you write what the current situation is and what you don't like about it.>>
<<You might also put down in a few lines what your solution entails>>

*Definition of done*
This issue is considered delivered when:
 * <<here you put down in bulletpoints what you will build>>
 * <<Formulate each bullet point as a verifiable result.>>

*Data model*
Here you can put diagrams about the data that your code interacts with

*Development steps*
 1. A list of steps that you plan on taking in order to reach the goals

  ```
* Feel free to start coding right away, but we might respond that we won't merge this PR or that we'll only merge it if it's changed a bit.
* Please read the list of things timbuctoo does and does not do in the README to check if there's a good chance that we'll merge your code.

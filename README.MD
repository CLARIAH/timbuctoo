Timbuctoo
=========

## What is Timbuctoo?
Timbuctoo is developed by Huygens ING. A part of it's activities is research based around historical events. 
Timbuctoo solves two problems. The first one is to provide an infrastructure where multiple research projects can store their data. The second is that it allows multiple projects to have different opinions about the stored data. So overlapping data can easily be shared between multiple projects.

## How does it work?
Timbuctoo is a Java REST-service, that uses the JAX-RS implementation Jersey. It uses a Mongo database to store the data. It uses Solr for faster search results. It supports real persistency by using a [Handle service](http://handle.net/). The whole system is tested using Apache Tomcat.
